# Car Wars
An attempt to computerize the paper-and-pencil game Car Wars, my favorite game by far from . . . back then.

Steve Jackson Games has published an old rule book for [Car Wars Classic](http://www.sjgames.com/car-wars/games/classic/) that I'm using. Local copy here [car-wars-classic-rules.pdf](./car-wars-classic-rules.pdf) to avoid hotlinking.

There are also [errata for Car Wars Classic](http://www.sjgames.com/car-wars/errata/classic.html). I haven't checked yet to see if they're reflected in the rules pdf.

# Why?
To learn React and Redux and bone up on related tech.

But also because I've just wanted to for a while. It's a great game and this project is hard. Well, Knuth's "medium," probably.
