start match
  reflex rolls
  set HCs (handling class)
  set initial starting HSes (handling status)

turns
  start turn
    last turn's HC (permanent) changes take effect - like wheel loss

  phases
    begin phase
      simul-speed change
    movement - serial
      with extra prompts for ties in speed
      show what for auto-move? (dead, completing maneuver, etc.)
      show possible targeting (w/ all the modifiers) even though can't shoot yet
      every maneuver drops HS and causes a handling roll
      collisions
    end phase
      simul-targeting
      also handle auto-firing here (plus dropped weapons on auto)
      simul-damage - show serialized?

  end turn
    Is this when automatic, non-dropped fire happens? Once a turn, but when?
    Fire
      - does the vehicle catch fire?
      - extinguish?
      - damage and possible explosion if on fire (p.30-1)
    HS += (HC > 1) ? HC : 1; if (HS > HC) { HS = HC }


end condition checks throughout?
